This is a fork of gemini-cli. The objective is to adapt the code of gemini-cli to use ZAI's API for benchmarking purposes. 

To be fair we would like to use as effectively as possible all of the features of ZAI's models.

Our objective is to:
1. Implement ZAI in gemini-cli with a clear implementation of the thinking capabilities of ZAI's GLM-4.7
2. Add a mode to disable thinking.
3. Connect gemini-cli websearch tool to ZAI's websearch API.

Here are a few extracts of ZAI's documentation:

# Thinking Mode

> GLM-4.7 offers multiple thinking modes for different scenarios. The sections below explain how to enable each mode, key considerations, and example usage.

## **Default Thinking Behaviour**

Thinking is activated by default in GLM-4.7, different from the default hybrid thinking in GLM-4.6.

> If you want to disable thinking, use:

```bash  theme={null}
"thinking": {
    "type": "disabled"
}
```

## **Interleaved thinking**

We support **interleaved thinking** by default (supported since GLM-4.5), allowing GLM to think between tool calls and after receiving tool results. This enables more complex, step-by-step reasoning: interpreting each tool output before deciding what to do next, chaining multiple tool calls with reasoning steps, and making finer-grained decisions based on intermediate results.

<Tip>
  When using interleaved thinking with tools, **thinking blocks should be explicitly preserved and returned together with the tool results.**
</Tip>

The detailed interleaved thinking process is as follows.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1766025484368img_v3_02t3_4677ac48-b748-44d8-a56f-8cbd599b51ag.jpg?attname=img_v3_02t3_4677ac48-b748-44d8-a56f-8cbd599b51ag.jpg)

## **Preserved thinking**

**GLM-4.7 introduces a new capability** in coding scenarios: the model can retain **reasoning content from previous assistant turns** in the context. This helps preserve reasoning continuity and conversation integrity, improves model performance, and increases cache hit rates—saving tokens in real tasks.

<Check>
  This capability is **enabled by default** on the **Coding Plan endpoint** and **disabled by default** on the **standard API endpoint**. If you want to enable **Preserved Thinking** in your product (primarily recommended for coding/agent scenarios), you can turn it on for the API endpoint by setting **"clear\_thinking": false**, and **you must return the complete**, unmodified reasoning\_content back to the API.

  All consecutive reasoning\_content blocks must **exactly match the original sequence** generated by the model during the initial request. Do not reorder or edit these blocks; otherwise, performance may degrade and cache hit rates may be affected.
</Check>

The detailed Preserved thinking process is as follows.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/176641919972020251222-235942.jpeg?attname=20251222-235942.jpeg)

## Turn-level Thinking

“Turn-level Thinking” is a capability that **lets you control reasoning computation on a per-turn basis**: within the same session, each request can independently choose to enable or disable thinking. This is a new capability introduced in GLM-4.7, with the following advantages:

* **More flexible cost/latency control:** For lightweight turns like “asking a fact” or “tweaking wording,” you can disable thinking to get faster responses; for heavier tasks like “complex planning,” “multi-constraint reasoning,” or “code debugging,” you can enable thinking to improve accuracy and stability.
* **Smoother multi-turn experience:** The thinking switch can be toggled at any point within a session. The model stays coherent across turns and keeps a consistent output style, making it feel “smarter when things are hard, faster when things are simple.”
* **Better for agent/tool-use scenarios:** On turns that require quick tool execution, you can reduce reasoning overhead; on turns that require making decisions based on tool results, you can turn on deeper thinking—dynamically balancing efficiency and quality.

## Example Usage

This applies to both **Interleaved Thinking** and **Preserved Thinking**—no manual differentiation is required. **Remember to return the historical** `reasoning_content`**to keep the reasoning coherent.**

# Deep Thinking

<Tip>
  Deep Thinking is an advanced reasoning feature that enables Chain of Thought mechanisms, allowing the model to perform deep analysis and reasoning before answering questions. This approach significantly improves the model's accuracy and interpretability in complex tasks, particularly suitable for scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning, logical analysis, and problem-solving.
</Tip>

## Features

The Deep Thinking feature currently supports the latest models in the GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.6 series. By enabling deep thinking, the model can:

* **Multi-step Reasoning**: Break down complex problems into multiple steps for gradual analysis and resolution
* **Logical Analysis**: Provide clear reasoning processes and logical chains
* **Improved Accuracy**: Reduce errors and improve answer quality through deep thinking
* **Enhanced Interpretability**: Display the thinking process to help users understand the model's reasoning logic
* **Intelligent Judgment**: The model automatically determines whether deep thinking is needed to optimize response efficiency

### Core Parameters

* **`thinking.type`**: Controls the deep thinking mode
  * `enabled` (default): Enable dynamic thinking, model automatically determines if deep thinking is needed
  * `disabled`: Disable deep thinking, provide direct answers
* **`model`**: Models that support deep thinking, such as `glm-4.6`, `glm-4.5`, `glm-4.5v`, etc.

## Web Search API

Web Search API is a search engine specifically designed for large language models. Building on the traditional capabilities of webpage crawling and ranking, it enhances intent recognition and returns results that are more suitable for LLM processing (webpage titles, URLs, summaries, site names, and favicons).

1. Intent-Enhanced Retrieval: Intelligently identifies the user’s query intent and automatically determines whether web search is needed.
2. Structured Output: Returns data formats optimized for LLMs, including titles, URLs, summaries, site names, and icons.
3. Customizable Search Scope: Allows developers to specify the number of results, domain constraints, and time ranges. It also supports adjustable summary lengths for fine-grained search behavior control.
4. Time-Aware Output Control: The response can include the webpage’s publication time, facilitating timeliness analysis and result ranking.

            "content": "According to Zhitong Finance APP, Macao's Composite Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.23% year-on-year and 0.16% month-on-month in April 2025. The data, released by Macao's Statistics and Census Service on May 23, reflects subtle shifts in Macao's consumer market.\n1. Changes in Macao's CPI\nData shows that the 12-month average composite CPI as of April 2025 rose 0.42% compared to the same period a year earlier (May 2023–April 2024). Among major categories, the price index for Recreation, Sports, and Culture rose 2.47% year-on-year, while Miscellaneous Goods and Services increased 1.82%, signaling potential economic recovery.\n2. Impact of Food and Rent\nFood and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose 0.48% year-on-year, driven by higher dining-out and takeaway costs. Housing and fuel prices also increased 0.21% due to rising rents. As tourism recovers, dining demand has pushed up service fees.\nHowever, prices for Communication (-3.01%), Clothing (-2.35%), and Transport (-1.67%) declined, complicating the overall CPI trend.\n3. Month-on-Month Changes\nCompared to March 2025, April's CPI rose 0.16%. Recreation, Sports, and Culture saw the largest increase (2.6%) due to higher hotel rates. Summer clothing launches and rebounding airfares also lifted Clothing (+0.78%) and Transport (+0.42%) prices.\nDespite this, Food and non-alcoholic beverages dipped slightly (-0.04%) as lower prices for fresh fish, seafood, vegetables, and fruit offset higher dining costs.\n4. CPI Classification\nMacao's CPI is compiled into three series to reflect price impacts on households with different spending patterns. Category A (50% of households) covers monthly expenditures of 11,000–35,999 MOP, while Category B (30%) covers 36,000–71,999 MOP.\nHousing and fuel (34.47%), food (29.47%), and transport (8.33%) carry the highest weights, ensuring precise reflection of consumption trends across income groups.\n5. Outlook\nMacao's consumer market will continue to face multiple influences. While some categories show price declines, the overall mild CPI rise suggests recovery potential. With tourism rebounding and demand growing, CPI may maintain a gradual upward trend.\nIn summary, April 2025's CPI changes reflect market dynamics and new cost-of-living challenges. Authorities must monitor price impacts to craft effective policies ensuring stable living standards. Return to Sohu for more.",

As a member of the Fed, her views and remarks may reflect the Fed's current thinking on the economic situation.

            "content": "As the global economic landscape continues to evolve, adjustments in macroeconomic policies and data releases by various countries are having a profound impact on the market. On April 14, 2025, multiple important financial events and data will emerge, which not only relate to the health of national economies but may also trigger chain reactions in global markets. This article provides a detailed analysis of the day's major financial events, offering deep insights for readers.\n1. Introduction to Market Phenomena: The Fluid Changes in the Global Economic Landscape\nIn recent years, the global economic situation has been highly volatile, with financial markets reacting sensitively. The economic data for Q1 2025 is about to be released, and its impact on foreign exchange, stock, and commodity markets cannot be underestimated. Especially amid the mutual influences of major economies like China, the U.S., and Europe, market investors are increasingly focusing on real-time data and changes in economic policies.\n2. State Council Information Office Releases Q1 Import and Export Data\nTime: 10:00\nChina's State Council Information Office will hold a press conference to release Q1 import and export data. This information is not just about numbers but also reveals the close ties between China and the global economic chain. The growth or decline in import and export data will directly affect GDP growth expectations, thereby influencing investor confidence.\nBy analyzing recent trade relations, it is evident that China plays a pivotal role in the global supply chain. Especially in the face of international economic fluctuations, China's import and export situation will serve as a market barometer, closely linked to trends in international commodity prices and the foreign exchange market. Achieving strong import and export performance will not only boost market confidence but also inject more vitality into domestic economic development.\n3. Canadian Wholesale Sales Data and Economic Analysis\nTime: 20:30\nOn the same day, Canada will release its February wholesale sales monthly rate data. Wholesale sales are an important indicator of retail demand expectations, directly reflecting the health of the economy.\nAnalysts point out that if the data shows strong sales growth, it may indicate a recovery in Canadian consumer confidence, while the opposite would suggest potential economic risks. Particularly during a rate hike cycle, changes in consumer spending will be especially important, influencing the Bank of Canada's monetary policy decisions and, to some extent, global market liquidity.\n4. Importance of U.S. Inflation Expectations\nTime: 23:00\nNext, the New York Fed will release the one-year inflation expectations data for March. This data is a key reference for assessing U.S. consumers' and businesses' views on future economic conditions.\nCurrently, the Fed is at a crossroads in addressing high inflation and reducing interest rate pressures. Rising inflation expectations may signal the need for further rate hikes, affecting capital market pricing. Conversely, if inflation shows signs of easing, it would indicate that policies are taking effect, potentially boosting market risk appetite.\n5. OPEC Crude Oil Market Report: A Barometer for Energy Prices\nTime: To be determined\nAround the same time, OPEC will release its monthly crude oil market report. This report typically influences global crude oil price trends.\n·\nExpand full text\nIn 2025, global energy agencies are generally facing the dual challenges of balancing market supply and demand with emission reduction policies. As global warming issues intensify, the balance between new energy development and traditional energy consumption in various countries will become increasingly important. Especially for countries reliant on oil and gas resources, this report will be a key reference for observing market adjustments.\n6. Views from Fed Officials: A Critical Moment for Market Interpretation\nTime: 00:00 and 06:00 the next day\nFed officials will deliver speeches on navigating economic uncertainties and sharing the Fed's role. These speeches will not only outline the future direction of Fed policy but also cast a shadow over economic uncertainties.\nThe market's focus on the Fed will influence global investor expectations, especially under the current intertwined scenarios of high inflation and high interest rates. Investors need to closely monitor the Fed's stance, which will not only affect the dollar's trajectory but also directly relate to the stability of commodity markets and the global financial system.\nConclusion: Financial Signals Investors Cannot Ignore\nIn summary, the major financial events and economic data on April 14, 2025, herald new changes in the global economy, warranting close attention from investors. On this day, the release of economic data and policy interpretations will intertwine, forming a barometer for market trends.\nWhile the global economy remains uncertain, investors must stay vigilant, monitor real-time information changes, and respond promptly. At the same time, diversifying investments and controlling risks will be wise choices to cope with market fluctuations. How to find stable investment opportunities in a changing economic environment is a crucial question every investor must consider.\nFinally, we hope that under the impetus of these financial events and data, a clearer and more stable development environment can emerge. Let us stay tuned and seize every possible opportunity. Return to Sohu for more.",
